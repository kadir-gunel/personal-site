title: About
---
I am an American student living in Montreal and finishing up my final year of
school at McGill University. I'm completing a joint degree in [Mathematics and
Computer Science](//www.mcgill.ca/study/2014-2015/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-joint-honours-mathematics-and-computer), and I picked up a Physics
minor along the way.

I have been working on web development for the past few years. Come October
2015, I will be working full-time at Google in New York City on
interactive search features. I interned on the same team in the summer of 2014.
For more information about my background as a developer, please see my [github 
account](//github.com/wetmore) or my [CV](/cv.pdf).

While I started university with the intention of leaving as a developer (which
is what ended up happening), I fell in love with math in my third year of school and switched into the Math/CS major starting in my fourth. My main interests lie in logic and formal reasoning, particularly the application of modal logics to verifying the behaviour of transition systems. I am also interested in the interplay between program behaviour and category theory and logic.
