## Talks and writing

### Logic

For [COMP-525](http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2014-2015/courses/comp-525), a course on Formal Verification, I gave a talk on the expressivity of the
[modal $\mu$-calculus $L\mu$](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_%CE%BC-calculus), 
describing the syntax and semantics of $L\mu$ as well as proving that it is
strictly more expressive than another modal logic called Propositional Dynamic
Logic. Slides for the presentation can be seen [here](/files/Lmu-pres.pdf), and
 a thorough companion paper covering the topics of the talk in more depth is
 [here](/files/Lmu-paper.pdf).

I later presented a more-complete version of the talk at
[SUMM](http://summ.math.uqam.ca/). This version begins with a description of 
transition systems and the use of logic to verify their properties, in order to 
motivate $L\mu$. Slides for this talk can be found [here](/files/summ.pdf).

### Web development

In 2014 I helped organize and give a series of 5 lessons on web development 
called Hack101 for [HackMcGill](http://hackmcgill.com/). In particular, I wrote 
and gave lessons [one](https://github.com/hack101/lesson1) and
[three](https://github.com/hack101/lesson3). The full set of lessons can be 
found [here](https://github.com/hack101).

### Physics

In the summer of 2013 I gave a talk describing the basics of quantum
teleportation. Slides can be found [here](/files/qt-pres.pdf).
