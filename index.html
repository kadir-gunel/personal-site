As the header suggests, this is the website for Matthew Wetmore (that's me). If
you'd like to know who I am, check out the <a href="/about.html">about</a> page.
If you'd like to know what I've done, check out the
<a href="/projects.html">projects</a> page. I also write about
math and programming, and one day I might write about some interesting topics
as well.
